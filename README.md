## 📌 What I Have Built

### 📝 Custom Rich Text Editor
- Built **from scratch** without third-party libraries (like Quill or TinyMCE).
- Supports **bold**, *italic*, _underline_, **text alignment** (left, center, right), and **font size adjustments**.
- Smooth, intuitive editing experience using native DOM APIs and React state management.

### 📚 Note Management
- **Create**, **Edit**, **Delete**, and **List** notes.
- **Pin notes** to the top with a pin icon indicator.
- **Encrypt notes** with a password for added privacy and security.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features (Gemini)
- 🔍 **Auto Glossary Highlighting**: Automatically detects key terms and highlights them with **tooltip definitions** on hover.
- 📌 **AI-Driven Insights**: Uses **Google Gemini API** to generate:
  - Summaries  
  - Key points  
  - Related concepts  
- ✅ **Grammar Check**: Detects grammatical errors, underlines them, and offers real-time suggestions.

### 🎤 Speech-to-Text
- Integrated **SpeechRecognition API** (browser-native).
- Users can **dictate** notes using voice, enhancing accessibility and productivity.

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Mobile-first design with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Optimized for **desktop, tablet, and smartphone** usage.
- Smooth touch and keyboard interactions.

### 💾 Data Persistence
